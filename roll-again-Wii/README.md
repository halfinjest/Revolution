# roll-again-Wii

This is a revision of the `roll-again` program for the Homebrew Channel.

Dice are rolled until the specified permutation has been rolled. The permutation is specified using the directional pad, the plus button, and the minus button on the Wii remote.

Press the A button to roll with the dice being displayed, or press the B button to roll without the dice being displayed.
